### Secret-chest

I'm working on Scratch2Python, a Scratch to Python converter.

I'm also working on some more stuff.
https://secret-chest.github.io

* Python
* HTML
* CSS
* Absolutely no server JavaScript
* Bash
* JavaScript for interactivity
* I would love to make GTK apps, but I can't since Windows won't support them

oh and if you're cool like me and installed [that font](github.com/C1710/blobmoji), you'll see cuter emojis. Even the newest ones! Thank me later.
